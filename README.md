# ScrabbleGamePart2
I have created a scrabble game using Python 3. In this game you have to make a word from the given tiles and if your word is valid, then the game shows you the score of your word as well as the word with highest score, it's score that the user could have created from the given tile and then finally places it on the board. (Before the game starts, it asks you for the size of the board you want for the game). If your word is not a valid word, then it will pop up a message accordingly in order to notify the user. ScrabbleGamePart2 is basically an extension of ScrabbleGamePart1 where the user is getting a board visualisation.
